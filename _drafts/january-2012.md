Inna was in Russia, and I was in NC, we were waiting for the permission to proceed with the paperwork for her immigration visa.  We were skyping a lot, like 24/7. :)  Karissa was born, and I took pictures for the birth announcements.  Irina came to Innaâ€™s box every week and they had Bible Study and Prayer time.
