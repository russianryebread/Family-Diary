I bought tickets to visit Inna in Russia, an engagement ring, and fancy clothing to impress her.  Mom said that we would prove that Americans can dress up in fancy clothing too.  I wanted to surprise Inna, and so I used Dave as an excuse for being out of contact for a couple of days, saying that he had problems (which was true) and that I would be flying up north, which was also true…but she was too smart, and figured that I was really coming there to see her.  My email follows:

> My HONEY!!!
> Dave's servers were having some problems, and his network was down, and his monitoring software was also not working...  Poor guy...  Anyway, I am taking a last-minute trip up north, and I am going to be flying, so I will be out of contact until late Monday night here / early Tuesday morning there... :((((  I'm SO sorry that this is so abrupt and last-minute. :(((((((
> I'm going to miss you SOOOO much honey... :(((  I'm glad we got to talk for a fairly long time last night!
> LOVE YOU SO MUCH, my DARLING!!!  I'll talk to you as SOON as possible, ok my love!?  I'll be missing you terribly and thinking about you ALL the time!!!!!!

> Tyamtins and Squeezes!!!!!!!!  Talk to you soon, my sweetie!!!!!

She dressed her little orange box all up with balloons, cards, signs, and all sorts of wonderful, welcoming things.  Johannes met me at the airport, and I stayed there for about a week, before moving to Sasha’s flat in Petergof.  On the 14th we went to Lenta, where I proposed to her and gave her the ring.  We just drank tea, because Inna was too cheap to buy food!  At her church, her friends were all jealous of her ring.

Sometime near the end of February, we got our invitation to the embassy in Moscow, scheduled for sometime in March.
