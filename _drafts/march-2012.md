We traveled to Moscow, and stayed the night at Masha & Valodya's flat, before getting up early the next morning for Inna's visa interview at the embassy.  The embassy wouldn't let anyone in the building except those who were there for the interview.  It was really cold out that day, and I froze on the street for 5 hours.  Several times, I went to a nearby mall to just thaw out a little, and marched back and forth, back and forth like a sentinal on guard duty.

After that, we went to Chocoladnetsa, and drank tea.  It was *really* good tea.  The blini was expensive!  In the afternoon, we met with Inna's dad, and spent time with him in Subway.  Then we went back to St. Pete on the night train.

The 23<sup>rd</sup> was Inna's Birthday.  She had to work, so I went to Lenta, got some candies and cooked her pizza.  We left for Moscow that evening.

The SunScool team had a meeting at Kolya's.  My passport was in the embassy of Kazakhstan, getting a visa so that we could go and see Inna's mom.  Since I didn't have a passport, I couldn't get on a train, so we had to take a bus all the way to Moscow.

Since we got into Zelenograd early in the morning, we had to walk all the way from the McDonalds to Kolya's flat.  It was really cold outside.  After the meeting at the church, we stayed several nights with Janice.  I fixed her sink and toilet, and we sang together.

We finally got both our passports back, and bought train tickets to Kazakhstan, and plane tickets to the good ole' US of A.  Finally.
