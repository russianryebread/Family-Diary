		“That I may <strong><em>know</em></strong> him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; <strong><em>If by any means</em></strong> I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

		Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, <strong><em>I press toward the mark</em></strong> for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”

		<cite>&mdash; The Apostle Paul in Philippians 3:10-14</cite>
